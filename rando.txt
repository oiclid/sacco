rewrite savings/admin.py so that:

Superadmins see all accounts

Admins see only accounts where account.user == request.user

Viewers see nothing

It will preserve all functionality:

Inline transaction ledger

Post monthly interest

Export CSV

Pretty balance display

Ordering, filtering, and search
